# Update-Data-From-URL
This utilizes CloudPageURL and AMPscript to push information to a data extension and update specific values. There is also use of the Output function to verify your page is working 

The functionality of this Sales Force feature utilizes the following 
1. Email with a cloudpageurl with the values you wish to record.
2. Cloudpage with the AMPscript that will capture and process the information
3. Data Extension to put the information on.

Think of a use case such as a survey with different questions to ask, yes, no etc. 

The cloudpage can function as a simple Thank you page to let the user know you have captured their response, and depending on their subscriber key and various other values you could display a coupon, login, or specific content based on their data. 

The Data extension can be the same one or a different depending on your data extension formatting, include the column for recording and the value will push that information to whichever data extension you declare.
